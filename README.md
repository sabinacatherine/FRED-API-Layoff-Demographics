# FRED-Layoff-Demographics
A K-means cluster analysis of layoff data as compared to education rates within minority groups

## Introduction

In this project, I performed an initial exploratory analysis of FRED US employment data as compared to education counts in two different minority groups. In doing so, I aimed to explore potential links between increased layoff rates and re-education rates among minority groups; as it is widely known that this is common in economic recession periods (where layoff rates would be higher).
